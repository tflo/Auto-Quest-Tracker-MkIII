# Auto Quest Tracker Mk III

The addon works with most known quest trackers, like Quester or Blizz's built-in quest tracker. If using with Kaliel's Tracker, make sure to have Kaliel's Auto Zone Tracking disabled.

This is a fork of a [fork](https://github.com/gamer-angel05/AutoQuestTracker) (last version: Jan 2021) of the [original AutoQuestTracker](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auto-quest-tracker) addon (last version: Jan 2018).

### New in version 2.0 ("Mk III"):

You can now disable/enable AQT with the slash commands `/aqt off` / `/aqt on`. This is a per-char setting. If disabled, the two main events (`ZONE_CHANGED`, `ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA`) are unregistered, so, resource-wise, this comes very close to unloading the addon entirely.

See Changelog (2.0) for the complete list of new features.

For more slash commands, enter `/aqt` in the chat. They are self-explanatory.
